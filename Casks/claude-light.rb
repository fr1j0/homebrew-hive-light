  app "Claude Light.app"

  caveats <<~EOS
    Launch Claude Light, then use "Install Claude Code hooks" from the menu
    to wire it into ~/.claude/settings.json.

    Current releases are unsigned interim builds (Apple notarization pending),
    so Gatekeeper may report the app as "damaged and can't be opened".
    Clear the quarantine flag and launch again:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Claude Light.app"
